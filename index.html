                <h3>Research Problem</h3>
                <p>1.	Do mothers concern about their food and mental health according to their body condition?<br>
                    Misinformation about nutrition during pregnancy can mislead expectant mothers. Pregnant women should receive accurate and reliable nutrition information from reputable sources and consume a varied and balanced diet.
                    Especially, mothers with anemia, diabetics, low and high BMI index must have a nutrition plan to maintain a healthy life.
                    Also, as untreated mental health issues can have negative effects on mothers and babies. Therefore, they are seeking mental health and support.
                <br>
                <br>
                    2.	Do mothers have an idea about the effect of the medicine they take during the pregnancy?<br>
                    Certain medicines can harm the developing fetus and result in birth abnormalities or other pregnancy issues. Even medications that are safe for people who are not pregnant might not be safe for expectant mothers and fetus growth rate and brain development. Also, some pregnant women avoid the medications prescribed by the doctor because of myths or misinformation without rely on accurate information from reputable sources. That also can have harmful effects on the developing fetus as well as the mother.
                <br>    
                <br>
                    3.	Can mothers get rapid answers to their problems those who have doubts which has to be solved?<br>
                    While pregnant, you could experience both excitement and anxiety. A lot of expectant mothers seek advice from their doctors and loved ones, but it is not always easy to acquire the help they require. This could be because of not having access to medical treatment, not having family support, or just feeling overwhelmed. Pregnant people without a solid support network may find it particularly challenging.
                <br>  
                <br>  
                    4.	Can mothers get some more details about the baby looking at the Ultrasound images?<br>
                    Pregnant mothers get to know about their baby's shape and growth through Ultrasound images, some mothers are eager to know more details such as growth rate, normality and abnormalities of their babies by the pregnancy time, despite of hearing that your baby is fine, which would give them more satisfaction and make their mental health better.

                       - This component would use image understanding processing to analyze a pregnant mother's monthly blood report and BMI value to identify if she is anemic, diabetic, or has a high or low BMI. It would then use computer vision and machine learning techniques to interpret the data and recommend an ideal diet plan for everyone based on their specific condition. Additionally, this component has a depression detection part which monitors the mother’s emotional state using Computer vision.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    2.	Building a system to find the effects of medicine on pregnant women and fetus.<br>
                       - This component would use optical character recognition to recognize the prescriptions. After identifying the medicines and the dose, system provides a detailed report about the effect of the medicine with the help of trained model.    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    3.	Providing an image analyzing system to analyze the fetus ultrasound images.<br>
                       - System detects baby's condition and growth by analyzing the ultrasound image using CNN and monitor the baby's health and growth rate after delivery by entering body measurements.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    4.	Providing an AI chatbot to get answers for mothers’ problems rapidly.<br>
